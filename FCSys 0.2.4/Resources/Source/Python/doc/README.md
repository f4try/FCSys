Documentation for FCRes
-----------------------

This is the top-level build directory for documenting FCRes.  All of the
documentation is written using [Sphinx], a [Python] documentation system built on
top of [reST].  This directory contains:
 - [make.py](make.py) - The build script to build the html or latex/PDF docs
 - [index.rst](index.rst) - The top-level include document for FCRes
 - other .rst files - Placeholders to automatically generate the documentation
 - [conf.py](conf.py) - The [Sphinx] configuration
 - [_static](_static) - Used by the [Sphinx] build system
 - [_templates](_templates) - Used by the [Sphinx] build system

To build the HTML documentation, install [Sphinx] and run the following command
in this directory:

    python make.py html

The top file of the results will be build/html/index.html.
